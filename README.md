This is my personal repository of resources, tools and great places to learn about code.

Here I've consolidated most of the assets I've found useful for my learning process, and I plan to keep adding new things as I find them along my path to become the best developer I can be.

Recommendations are always welcome. You can email them to coccagerman@gmail.com
